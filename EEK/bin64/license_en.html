<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>EMSISOFT LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT</h1>
<BR/>
<P>
Please read this agreement
carefully! By installing the delivered software, you agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of the agreement below. If you do
not agree to these terms and conditions, terminate the installation
procedure and do not use the delivered software any further.
Violation of these terms and conditions could constitute copyright
infringement, resulting in civil and criminal proceedings.</P>
<BR/>
<h2>1.	<U>License</U></h2>
<P>
1.1.	The Licenser is Emsisoft Ltd, located in 315a Hardy
St, Nelson 7010, New Zealand. The object
of this license agreement is the granting of a nontransferable and
nonexclusive right of use authorization for the computer programs
recorded on the data media, including the program description, user
manual and documentation, to you, the Licensee.
For the sake of simplicity, the entire package is referred to
hereinafter as &quot;Software&quot;.</P>
<P>
1.2.	The terms and conditions of this agreement shall
also apply to Software updates issued in the future.
Upon formation of this license agreement, you also agree to a
maintenance agreement under which you will receive regular updates of
the delivered software.</P>
<BR/>
<h2>2.	<U>Scope of License</U></h2>
<P>
2.1.	The Software may be used solely for the term of
this agreement and solely on a single computer system (a central
computer) and at a single location. The
use of the Software in networks or on multiple PCs may take place
subject to the purchase of additional network or multiple user
licenses that have been issued for the number of PCs on which this
Software will be used. If you do not
have the appropriate license, agreement must be reached with us and
the necessary number of supplementary licenses purchased.
The simultaneous transfer of the Software to another computer
is illegal. In particular, it is illegal
to make the Software licensed for single or multiple use accessible
by any means and/or directly or indirectly available for use or
exploitation to third parties for compensation or free of charge.
In particular, any use of the Software on servers is also
illegal, insofar as it serves to screen the data traffic of third
parties for malware, etc., even if such parties are contracting
partners of the Licensee (e.g. Access or Mailbox clients).
Exploitation of the Software for these purposes requires the
express written consent of the Licenser. Products and product
editions marked as &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; or &ldquo;free software&rdquo;
must be used exclusively by you or members of your household solely
for private non-commercial purposes, and commercial use requires the
express written consent of the Licenser or purchase of licenses for
commercial use. Products that are marked as &ldquo;portable&rdquo;
may be used on multiple PCs.</P>
<P>
2.2.	Diskettes, CDs or other copies of the Software may
not be transmitted for any purpose, including private purposes,
unless we expressly consent to this transmission in writing.
Without our written consent, the Software &ndash; with the
exception of interventions permitted by law &ndash; may not be
decompiled, re-engineered, disassembled or in any other way presented
in a form that can be recognized by humans. Furthermore, without our
written consent, the Software may not be modified, adapted, sold or
surrendered by any means to third parties for use free of charge or
for compensation, insofar as this is not permitted according to this
agreement or is imperative under statutory regulations.</P>
<BR/>
<h2>3.	<U>Warranty</U></h2>
<P>
3.1.	We warrant that within the meaning of the
documentation and in accordance with the state of art at the moment
of delivery the Software is free of defect and fundamentally usable,
without however being sufficient for all possible application
conditions. You acknowledge that under
the current state of technology the development of error-free
software is not possible. This applies
in large degree to the field of combating malware, where new viruses,
Trojan horses, worms and comparable programs constantly arise that
have been specially created to circumvent malware protection
programs.</P>
<P>
3.2.	We do not warrant, therefore, that the Software can
be used for all of your requirements, or that the functions contained
in the Software can be used uninterrupted and error-free in
combination with any and all the data, programs and computer systems
you desire, or that it can be ruled out that other software errors
might arise as a result of corrections to software errors.
In addition, we do not provide warranty for errors,
disruptions or damage that are attributable to unskilled operation,
transport damage, operating system errors, modified operating system
components, interfaces and parameters or the use of unsuitable
organizational media and data media.</P>
<P>
3.3.	The warranty shall expire if without our written
consent you yourself carry out or a third party carries out
modifications or reconditioning of the Software.
We also cannot acknowledge expenses incurred in this context.
We shall accept no responsibility whatsoever for software that
is used, expanded or damaged, or that, among other things, is used in
a manner that differs from the contractually agreed terms of use,
unless the modification, expansion or damage was not the cause of the
defect.</P>
<P>
3.4.	We must be informed in writing of any defects in
the Software within no more than eight days &ndash; for consumers,
however, by expiry of the statutory periods &ndash; after they have
been identified; otherwise the warranty shall lapse.
The warranty period shall amount by mutual consent to two
years for consumers; otherwise it amounts to six months.</P>
<P>
3.5.	The licensor delivers the software in the basic
languages German, English and French and does not guarantee the
correctness of further software localizations that come with it. The
corresponding translators are solely responsible for contents and
maintenance of these supplementary language packs.</P>
<P>
3.6.	You are aware of and accept that the software also
detects and alerts so-called &quot;Potentially Unwanted Programs&rdquo;
(PUPs) that do not comply with the specifications of malware, but are
mostly to be considered unwanted software due to certain behavior
patterns.</P>
<BR/>
<h2>4.	<U>Damage claims</U></h2>
<P>
4.1.	Damage claims against us are excluded, insofar as
liability does not occur as a result of intent or gross negligence as
prescribed by law. The disclaimer of
warranty pertains in particular as well to damages by viruses or
similar programs, since according to the state of art it is not
possible to effectively combat malware 100% of the time.
Liability for consequential loss, including loss of profit,
and for indirect damages is also excluded.
Furthermore, any liability of ours for damages that arise from
unauthorized interventions is also excluded, as is liability for
defective operation or installation.</P>
<P>
4.2.	We strongly recommend that you make regular backup
copies of the data found on your computers.
Insofar as you do not comply with this duty to mitigate loss,
we shall not be liable for damages arising from this violation.
This limitation of liability does not apply, if the event
causing the damage was caused by gross negligence or intent; however,
even during the assessment of compensation the missing backup copy
shall be regarded as contributory negligence.</P>
<P>
4.3.	You know and accept, under your own responsibility
that details of detected and manually quarantined objects, blocked
websites, hosts and programs as well as created configurations, so
called &ldquo;application rules&rdquo; can be sent to Emsisoft
servers.</P>
<P>
4.4.	You know and accept that a guaranteed detection of
malware is technically not possible and that the Software may cause
&quot;false alerts&quot;, especially with behavior based detection of
malicious code.</P>
<BR/>
<h2>5.	<U>Commencement and term of the license agreement</U></h2>
<P>
5.1.	This agreement shall come into effect by mutual
consent between you and us, but no later than by the actual
installation of this software undertaken by you on a PC.
Express mutual consent can be stated in writing, by regular
mail, by e-mail or also by personal pickup or receipt.</P>
<P>
5.2.	This agreement runs for the minimum period
originally agreed to between you and us in accordance with the
separate agreement (see invoice). During the contractual period, we
will continuously improve, maintain and update the Software delivered
to you. In particular, we will ensure
that the Software will also recognize previously unrecognized
malware, and similar software. We will make the necessary program
updates available via the online update feature of the Software.
Should it be necessary to replace existing software products because
of technical developments, you will get the new software from us for
new installation. In this case, our customer center is at your
disposal.</P>
<P>
5.3.	A fee will be agreed upon for the granted license
as well as regularly executed updates under the maintenance
agreement. We reserve the right to
modify prices. If price increases are
announced, you are entitled to terminate the contract relationship
with due observance of the contractual notice period.</P>
<P>
5.4.	This agreement runs for a minimum of the term
chosen by you. Further use of this
Software is illegal upon expiry of this contractual relationship.
In this event you are obligated to destroy the original data
medium including all copies and documentation.
Further use of the Software beyond the day on which the
agreement was terminated shall constitute copyright violation.</P>
<P>
5.5.	If you violate one of the terms and conditions of
this agreement, in particular with regard to the scope of the rights
granted to you, we are entitled to terminate this agreement with
immediate effect. In this event, any
further use of the Software is also illegal.</P>
<BR/>
<h2>6.	<U>Final Provisions</U></h2>
<P>
6.1.	This agreement is subject to New Zealand law to the
exclusion of the UN rights of purchase. Legal
venue for all disputes arising from this agreement and on the
occasion of its termination is the competent court for commercial
matters in Nelson, NZ. If, however, you are a consumer, the
applicable venue is your place of general jurisdiction.
To be legally valid, modifications and supplements to this
agreement require the written form and the legally binding signature
of the contracting partner; this also applies to the revocation of
the written form requirement.</P>
<BR/>
<h2><U>Terms of Service</U></h2>
<BR/>
<P>By using our paid and free of cost desktop and online services, you
agree to our <A HREF="https://www.emsisoft.com/en/company/terms/" hrf="terms"><U>Terms of Service</U></A>.</P>
<BR/>
<h2><U>Privacy Policy</U></h2>
<BR/>
<P>We require collection and processing of certain personal data to provide
the services, as outlined in our <A HREF="https://www.emsisoft.com/en/company/privacy/" hrf="privacy"><U>Privacy Policy</U></A>.</P>
<BR/>
<P>
If you do not agree with the terms
and conditions of this license agreement, an agreement between us
shall not be formed, and you shall not be entitled to install or
activate the Software. If, however, you proceed to install
and/or activate it, you thereby declare your agreement with the terms
and conditions of the license. If you want to terminate this
contract, please contact us.</P>
